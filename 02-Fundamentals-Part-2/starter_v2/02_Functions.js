/*Functions

    Write a function called describeCountry which takes three parameters: country, population and capitalCity. Based on this input, the function returns a string with this format: 'Finland has 6 million people and its capital city is Helsinki'.

    Call this function 3 times, with input data for 3 different countries. Store the returned values in 3 different variables, and log them to the console.

    sample:

        United States
        Population: Approximately 331 million (as of 2022)
        Capital City: Washington, D.C.

    China
        Population: Approximately 1410 million (as of 2022)
        Capital City: Beijing

    Brazil
        Population: Approximately 213 million (as of 2022)
        Capital City: Bras√≠lia
